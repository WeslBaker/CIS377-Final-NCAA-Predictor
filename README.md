# CIS377-Final-NCAA-Predictor
Final Project for FHU CIS 377-Artificial Intelligence. Using SVM, decision trees, and other AI techniques to predict the NCAA tournament.

The following python libs will need to be installed in you environment:
  pandas
  numpy
  sklearn
  
Download the data file listed under the data tab, since that is the data used in the model. Make sure to have all files of the project downloaded and in the same folder so they can all be accessed by the code. You should only have to run the main file, predictor.py, to get the results from each of the six different models.
As visible within the files, our code is largely contained within various functions, which should allow for further experimentation and customization.
